J. DEFENSIVE DRIVING POLICY AND PROCEDURES
</span>
</p>


<span class = "span_10">
<ol class= "lista">
<li>Intersection getting into and out of intersection without an accident is a mark of a good defensive driver. Besides, your own skill level, intersections also demand anticipation of the actions of other drivers and taking appropriate evasion action is required.</li>
<li>Backing Backing is an extremely hazardous maneuver. If you are backing with the assistance of a guide, the ultimate responsibility for the safety of the backing maneuver remains with you as the driver.</li>
<li>Front-End Collisions the primary way to avoid front-end collisions is maintaining a safe and adequate following distance. You should be prepared for possible obstructions on the roadway, either in plain sight or hidden by curves or the crest of hills. A special situation occurs at night, when speed should be kept to a level that will allow you to stop within the distance illuminated by the headlights of your vehicle.</li>
<li>Rear-End Collisions as a driver, you risk being struck from behind if you do not maintain an adequate margin of safety in your own following distance. If enough space is it not allowed in front of your vehicle, chances go way up that somebody can (and will) impact you from the rear.</li>
<li>Passing.</li>
</ol>
</span>


<p class = "parrafo_10">
<span class = "span_10">
Failure to pass safely indicates faulty judgment on your part as a defensive driver, and failure to consider one or more of the factors that need to be checked:
</span>
</p>


<span class = "span_10">
<ol class= "lista">
<li>Room ahead</li>
<li>Adequate space to move back into the lane of traffic after passing</li>
<li>Signaled intentions</li>
<li>Being Passed You must be aware of the actions of other drivers, and give way if another driver begins to sideswipe you or to cut you off. A good defensive driver will avoid problems with this kind of accident situation.</li>
<li>Encroaching on Other Traffic Lanes Observant defensive drivers will not usually get trapped when other drivers change lanes abruptly. In the same manner, entrapment in merging traffic can be successfully avoided by a good defensive driver with a little preplanning and willingness to yield. Blind spots are not valid excuses for this kind of accident. Allowances must be made in areas of limited sight distance.</li>
<li>Road Hazards This includes: soft shoulder and severe pavement drop-offs that can cause a rollover accident; and road debris such as: tire recaps, metal, or lumber, that can cause severe damage to tires, tire rims, electrical systems, and brake lines. You should be aware of the road ahead to identify potential road debris early and take safe and appropriate avoidance maneuvers.</li>


<li>Underpasses Hitting a bridge, underpass, or viaduct is a danger you should be constantly aware of. This type of accident, often referred to as “topping” a trailer, is always preventable. You must be aware of posted heights before under passing. Re-paving and packed snow can reduce the clearance of an overpass enough to cause a problem. In addition, an empty trailer will ride higher than when it is loaded. You should make thorough trip plans. When in doubt of the clearance of an underpass, you should get out of your vehicle and make a visual inspection or find and alternate route.</li>
<li>Fixed Objects and Special Intersections A good defensive driver will observe items in the area around the vehicle that might cause problems. Checking to be certain there is adequate clearance is the primary thing to watch. In the areas of driveways, alleyways, or plant entrances, the effective defensive driver will analyze the situation carefully, slow down, sound a warning when appropriate, and be ready to yield to the other driver involved.</li>
<li>Following Distance Tailgating is probably the single most common complaint lodged by the general driving public against truck drivers. You should use a 3-seconds interval at speeds up to 40mph, and 4-seconds at speeds over 41mph. Add extra time in bad weather conditions, and add extra following distance if you are being tailgated.</li>
<li>Right of Way You should never attempt to exercise the right of way principle. Let the other driver go first. Keep to the right except to pass, or when getting into position to turn left. In town, when you enter a main thoroughfare from a side street, alley, driveway, or a highway ramp, make a full stop at any crosswalk, then another full stop before actually moving into traffic.</li>


<li>Curves and Turns Always slow down. That way you will be able to make any needed adjustments in steering as required.</li>
<li>Railroad Grade Crossings Driving across railroad crossings, or in areas where there are rail vehicles of some sort, demands special care. Careful observance of the traffic situation is your best defense.</li>
<li>Pedestrians Always assume that if there is a pedestrian involved in a situation, slowing down is your best defense.</li>
<li>Road Construction When facing road construction make sure you follow special posted speed limits while traveling through construction work zones. Be extremely careful of workers moving around.</li>

K. EXTREME WEATHER AND ROAD CONDITIONS POLICY AND PROCEDURES
</span>
</p>

<p class = "parrafo_10">
<span class = "span_10">
Bad weather and other road hazards place special stress upon any defensive driver. The best rule is get off the road safely and as soon as possible. If you absolutely must continue, slowing way down and increasing following distance are your best defenses, along with increased awareness
</span>
</p>


<span class = "span_10">
<ol class= "lista">
<li>Fog Fog reduces available visibility and impairs distance perception, making it perhaps the most dangerous type of extreme weather condition.</li>
</ol>
</span>


<p class = "parrafo_10">
<span class = "span_10">
Whenever possible, drivers are to avoid driving in foggy conditions. Pull off the road and park safely until such time as the fog dissipates or is burned off, if at all possible. If you cannot safely pull off the road, follow these procedures:
</span>
</p>

<span class = "span_10">
<ol class= "lista">
<li>Never assume the depth or thickness of any fog. Fog can range from a momentary blurring of the windshield to being several miles thick.</li>
<li>Slow down your vehicle’s speed gradually in order to avoid becoming a hazard for other motorists.</li>
<li>Use low-beam headlights only when driving in fog. This help you see the immediate roadway and also allow other motorists to see your vehicle.</li>
<li>Avoid the use of high-beam headlights. They will reduce your visibility.</li>
<li>Make use of windshield wipers and defroster. Foggy conditions cause a constant mist of water, reducing visibility.</li>
<li>Avoid passing other vehicles.</li>
<li>Avoid stopping on any roadway while driving in foggy conditions, unless absolutely necessary. If you must stop, use the emergency or breakdown lane, activate your emergency flashers, and turn off the headlights.</li>
<li>Rain Rain causes roadways to be slippery, especially when it first begins. Water on the road surface can create a potential hazard of hydroplaning. Hydroplaning happens when a thin layer of water separates the vehicle’s tires from the road surface, it is literally riding on water. You lose all traction and create an extremely dangerous situation. The faster a vehicle travels on standing water, the greater the chance of hydroplaning. Reducing speed is the best and safest way to avoid hydroplaning.</li>
</ol>
</span>


<p class = "parrafo_10">
<span class = "span_10">
Rain also reduces visibility You must adhere to the following procedures:
</span>
</p>

<span class = "span_10">
<ol class= "lista">
<li>Slow down your speed to avoid hydroplaning. This should be done gradually.</li>
<li>Increase the following distance from other motorists. It will allow more distance if you need to stop.</li>
<li>Use your wipers and defrost to increase your visibility.</li>
<li>Avoid passing other vehicles. Following other vehicles at a safe distance traveling ahead will throw water off the pavement and leave “tracks”. Driving in these tracks will give you the best possible traction under rainy conditions.</li>
</ol>
</span>



<p class = "parrafo_10">
<span class = "span_10">
Snow can present a variety of dangerous conditions. Because of this, you must follow these procedures:
</span>
</p>


<span class = "span_10">
<ol class= "lista">
<li>Light, powderysnow: It is usually blown of the road surface. However, if there is enough of this type of snow to cover the roadway, it will form a slick, smooth surface. You should reduce speed and increase following distance.</li>
<li>Heavier, slushy snow: it can affect your vehicle control. If snow becomes hard packed it can cause an ice hazard on the road surface. Reduce speed and increase following distance. Do slow maneuvers and smoothly and with extreme care to maintain vehicle control.</li>
<li>Snowy and foggy: the use the high-beam headlights should be avoided. The high beam will reflect off falling and blowing snow and reflect back to you, further reducing visibility.</li>
<li>Blowing snow: can greatly reduce visibility. Again, reduce speed and increase following distance.</li>
<li>Extreme conditions: in addition to all the above, chains may be necessary.</li>
</ol>
</span>


<p class = "parrafo_10">
<span class = "span_10">
Ice:
</span>
</p>

<span class = "span_10">
<ol class= "lista">
<li>If you must continue with icy road, the safest technique is always to reduce speed and increase following distance. But increasing the following distance is far the most import. Depending on the temperature, the stopping time can increase from four to times from the same time needed on a dry road. Black Ice forms when temperatures drop rapidly and any moisture on the road surfaces freezes into a smooth, almost transparent layer of ice. What makes black ice particularly dangerous is that you may not realize you are on it until it is too late.</li>
<li>Bridges and overpasses tend to form ice first because cold air circulates both above and below these structures, causing the temperature to drop more rapidly than on normal roads.</li>
